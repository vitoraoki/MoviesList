# Overview
`MoviesList` is an app created to practice key Android development concepts such as Clean Architecture, MVVM, pagination, network requests, dependency injection, and the design of more complex layouts.
Itâ€™s a simple application that displays a list of movies currently playing in theaters. When a movie card is tapped, it shows additional details about the selected film.
All data used in the app is sourced from the [TMDB (The Movie Database) API](https://www.themoviedb.org), and all rights to the data are reserved by TMDB.

# Technologies
The technologies used in this project include:

- Dagger Hilt
- Retrofit
- Paging3
- Jetpack Compose
- Jetpack Navigation
- Kotlin Coroutines
- JUnit
- MockK

# Improvements
With more development time, some improvements could be made to the app:

- Caching of the movie list and movie details using Room Database
- Pull-to-refresh and automatic retry after pagination request errors
- More polished and refined UI layout
- Android instrumented tests
